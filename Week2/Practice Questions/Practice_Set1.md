# 🚀 SoC Trackathon - Practice Set 1

Welcome to **Practice Set 1** of the Trackathon Series under the Summer of Code initiative at our college!  
These exercises are designed to help you practice basic programming logic and build a solid foundation before diving into advanced topics.

Each problem focuses on a core concept like functions, conditionals, strings, or loops.

## 💡 Submission Guidelines

- Create a new folder named `practice-set-1` inside your repository.
- Create separate files for each question:  
  `q1.py`, `q2.py`, ... `q10.py` (or `.js`, `.cpp`, `.java` depending on your language).
- Add comments in your code for clarity.
- Push your code to GitHub before the weekly check-in.

## ✅ Tips

- Try to write clean and readable code.
- Use proper function names and indentation.
- Test your solution with different inputs.
- Feel free to ask mentors for help!
