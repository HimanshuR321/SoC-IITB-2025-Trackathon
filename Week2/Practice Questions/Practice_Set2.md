# 🚀 SoC Trackathon - Practice Set 2

Welcome to **Practice Set 2** of the Trackathon Series!  
This set focuses on working with **functions, arrays, objects, closures, and data transformations** — essential concepts for mastering logic building. All the codes are need to be written in Javascript language (.js files) only.


The goal of this practice is to strengthen your understanding of closures, object manipulation, and array methods while learning to write cleaner, modular, and reusable code.

## 📝 Problem List

1. **Function: `greet`**  
   Write a function called `greet` that takes a name parameter and logs a greeting message to the console.

2. **Function: `getSquare`**  
   Write a function called `getSquare` that takes a number parameter and returns its square.

3. **Function: `countLetters`**  
   Write a function called `countLetters` that takes a string parameter and returns an object that contains a count of each letter in the string.

4. **Function: `createCounter`**  
   Write a function called `createCounter` that returns another function.  
   The returned function should increment a counter variable each time it is called and return the current count.

5. **Function: `sumEvenNumbers`**  
   Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.

6. **Function: Sum All Numbers in an Array**  
   Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

7. **Function: Filter Long Strings**  
   Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument and returns a new array with only the strings that have a length greater than 5.

8. **Function: Get Object Keys**  
   Write a function that takes an object and returns an array of all the keys in the object.

9. **Function: Get Property Values from Array of Objects**  
   Write a function that takes an array of objects and returns an array of all the values of a specified property name.
