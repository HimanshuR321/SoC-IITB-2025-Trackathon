# Week 2 – Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to Week 2 of the Trackathon journey.

Hey guys! I know Week 1 was a bit boring — after all, who loves writing markup and styling all day? But now we’re stepping into the **king of web development** — **JavaScript**.

This week, you’ll begin your JavaScript journey. It’s the language that brings websites to life — adding interactivity, logic, and intelligence to otherwise static pages.

## ▶️ Getting Started with JavaScript

> [!TIP]
> To get started, watch this video on how to set up JavaScript in VS Code and run your first programs.  
> [![Install JavaScript & Setup in VS Code](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ic_qG65iYNE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Ic_qG65iYNE?si=-7a058281edXfRHq)

## Folder Structure

Inside the `Week2` folder, you’ll find:

- `Practice Questions/`
  - `Practice_Set1.md`: Core logic-based problems to build your JavaScript thinking.
  - `Practice_Set2.md`: Slightly advanced, builds on Set 1 — designed to make you think.
- `Reading Material/`
  - `Reference Notes (Handwritten).pdf`: One of the best handwritten JavaScript note collections I could find online (though not created by me). Don’t blindly memorize — read, understand, and absorb the logic.

## Learning Plan

1. **Watch the Video**  
   Set up your editor and understand how to run JavaScript in your system.

2. **Read through the Reference Notes**  
   Skim first, then deep dive later as you attempt problems.

3. **Solve the Practice Questions**  
   These problems are hand-picked to give you a compact and effective intro to JavaScript.
   > Try to write code on your own for every problem. Don’t copy-paste.

## Guidelines

- Avoid using AI tools to write or debug code. You’ll thank yourself later.
- Use these documentation links while learning:
  - [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - [W3Schools JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
  - [CodeHelp JavaScript Docs](https://www.codehelp.in/tutorial/javascript/java-script-a-beginner-s-guide-to-programming-magic-1)

## Assignment Instructions

Although you are **not required to submit** all the codes this time, **1 day before the deadline**, I will assign **2 questions** from the practice sets to each one of you.

✅ You will need to submit only those 2 assigned questions as your submission.

So stay consistent, and complete all the problems in time.

## Support

Got stuck? Don’t waste too much time.  
Reach out in the group chat or **DM me** directly with your doubts. Just explain your issue clearly and add screenshots if needed.

This week will shape your logical thinking. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the magic of JavaScript!

Let's build it 💪
