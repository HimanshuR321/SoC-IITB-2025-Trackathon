# Week 2 – Introduction to JavaScript 🪄

Welcome to Week 2 of the Trackathon journey.

Hey champs! was a bit boring — after all, who loves writing markup and writing those css styling all day? But guess what? Just like **RCB finally winning the IPL trophy**, your patience is about to pay off.

Because this week… we enter the realm of **JavaScript — the king 👑 of web development**.

JavaScript adds logic, superpowers, and *vibe* to your webpages. Without it, websites are just fancy posters — beautiful, but dead.

## ▶️ Getting Started with JavaScript

Before you jump into it, get your environment setup ready to code in javascript.  
Watch this video to install and run JavaScript in VS Code like a pro:

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Inside the `Week2` folder:

- `Practice Questions/`
  - `Practice_Set1`: Core beginner-friendly questions that’ll flex your logical muscles.
  - `Practice_Set2`: Slightly moderate ones, builds on Set 1 — designed to make you think.
- `Reading Material/`
  - `Reference Notes (Handwritten)`: Possibly one of the best handwritten JavaScript note collections I could share with you (though not created by me - but I wish I had). Don’t blindly memorize — read, understand, and absorb the logic.

📌 **Note**: Don’t blindly memorize from the notes like it’s a viva — read to understand. JavaScript is not a parrot game.

## 🧠 Learning Plan

1. **Set up JavaScript**  
    Set up your editor and understand how to run JavaScript in your system.

2. **Read through the Reference Notes**  
   Your first read = overview. Second read = learning. Third read = realisation that JavaScript is fun.

3. **Code the Practice Questions**  
   These problems are hand-picked by me to learn Javascript in shortest span of time and to give you a compact and effective intro to JavaScript.
   > Try to write code on your own for every problem. 
   > 🧘 Don’t copy-paste — write, debug, cry (a little), and repeat.

## 📜 Guidelines

This week:  
**Avoid using AI tools to write or debug code. Use documentations, watch youtube tutorials, ask doubts. You’ll thank yourself later.**

Explore documentation (your new best friend):
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [W3Schools JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

## 📌 Assignment Instructions

No big assignment this week — but don’t relax like it’s Sunday IPL.

**A day before the deadline**, I’ll assign **2 questions** to each of you from the practice sets.

📤 You will need to submit those 2 as your official submission via this form:  
👉 [Submit Your Assigned Questions Here](#)
So don’t skip practice or you’ll feel like India during a 2023 World Cup final. 😬

## 💬 Support

Stuck? Don't suffer in silence like unresponsive code.  
Reach out in the group chat or **DM me** with the problem, screenshot, or even an error log that looks like it came from NASA.

## Final Words

JavaScript is where logic meets creativity. It's going to be fun, confusing, and deeply satisfying.

So tighten your seatbelt, fire up VS Code, and let’s build some magic together.

Let’s goooo 🚀

**P.S.**: Yes, RCB won. And yes, you’ll win too — just keep coding. 🏆
