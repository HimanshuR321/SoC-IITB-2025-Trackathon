# Week 2 – Introduction to JavaScript 🪄

Welcome to Week 2 of the Trackathon journey.

Hey champs! I know Week 1 felt like chewing cardboard — who really enjoys typing HTML tags and tweaking CSS margins all day? But guess what? Just like **RCB finally winning the IPL trophy**, your patience is about to pay off.

Because this week… we enter the realm of **JavaScript — the king 👑 of web development**.

JavaScript adds logic, superpowers, and *vibe* to your webpages. Without it, websites are just fancy posters — beautiful, but dead.

## ▶️ Getting Started with JavaScript

Before you become the next Brendan Eich, get your environment ready.  
Watch this video to install and run JavaScript in VS Code like a pro:

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (a.k.a. your JavaScript dojo)

Inside the `Week2` folder:

- `Practice Questions/`
  - `Practice_Set1.md`: Core beginner-friendly questions that’ll flex your logical muscles.
  - `Practice_Set2.md`: Slightly tougher ones, for when you’re warmed up and ready to rumble.
- `Reading Material/`
  - `Reference Notes (Handwritten).pdf`: Possibly the best handwritten JavaScript notes out there. I didn’t make them, but I wish I had.

📌 **Note**: Don’t blindly memorize from the notes like it’s a viva — read to understand. JavaScript is not a parrot game.

## 🧠 Learning Plan

1. **Set up JavaScript**  
   Watch the video above. No setup = no glory.

2. **Skim the Notes, Then Dive Deep**  
   Your first read = overview. Second read = learning. Third read = realisation that JavaScript is fun.

3. **Code the Practice Questions**  
   The sets are like gym workouts for your brain.  
   > 🧘 Don’t copy-paste — write, debug, cry (a little), and repeat.

## 📌 Assignment Instructions

No formal assignment this week — but don’t relax like it’s Sunday IPL.

**A day before the deadline**, I’ll assign **2 questions** to each of you from the practice sets.

📤 You will need to submit those 2 as your official submission.  
So don’t skip practice or you’ll feel like India during a 2023 World Cup final. 😬

## 💬 Support

Stuck? Don't suffer in silence like unresponsive code.  
Ping in the group or **DM me** with the problem, screenshot, or even an error log that looks like it came from NASA.

## Final Words

JavaScript is where logic meets creativity. It's going to be fun, confusing, and deeply satisfying.

So tighten your seatbelt, fire up VS Code, and let’s build some magic together.

Let’s goooo 🚀

**P.S.**: Yes, RCB won. And yes, you’ll win too — just keep coding. 🏆
