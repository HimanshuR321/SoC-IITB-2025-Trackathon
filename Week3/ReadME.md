# Week 3 – DOM, Events & Asynchronous JavaScript 🏋️‍♂️

Welcome to Week 3 of the Trackathon journey!

By now, you’ve stretched your basics and lifted some logic reps with core JavaScript. This week, we head to the **next level of gains** — Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous code.

Think of HTML as the skeleton, CSS as the style — and **JavaScript as the muscles** that bring the body to life.

So let's start with week 3.

## ▶️ DOM Concepts & Setup (Optional but 🔥 Recommended)

You don’t need to install anything new this week. But before hitting your reps, warm up with this **DOM and JavaScript essentials video**: 
This video is good especially to understand DOM and to crystal clear a few concepts as per your need.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Inside the `Week3` folder:

- `Practice Questions/`
  - `Practice_Set3`: Covers DOM manipulation, events, and basic UI interactions.
  - `Practice_Set4`: Dives into promises, async/await, and error handling — real-world JavaScript essentials.
- `Reading Material/`
  - 📝 Yes. 

📌 **Note**: The **handwritten notes from Week 2** already cover everything needed for this week. No need to search elsewhere — just refer back to those if you're stuck.

## 🧠 Learning Plan

1. **Watch the DOM Video (linked above)**  
   You’ll understand how JavaScript truly interacts with web pages.

2. **Revisit the Week 2 Notes**  
   Yes, again — they’ve got async/await and event handling basics too.

3. **Smash the Practice Sets**  
   These sets are where real JavaScript fluency begins. It’s time to level up your logic and interaction skills.

## 📜 Assignment Instructions

🧾 For assignment of this week, we will follow the same pattern as of week 2 was.

A day before the deadline, each of you will be assigned **2 questions** from this week’s practice sets. 
👉 [Submit Your Assigned Questions Here](https://forms.gle/RPRFiGWPDAnCjD5Z9)
**Deadline: 21st June, 11:59PM**

So if you don’t practice now, you’ll struggle like someone who skipped leg day before trek season.

## 📌 Guidelines

This week’s success mantra:

> **Lift the logic, DOMinate the bugs.**

Again speaking, avoid AI tools. Instead:
- Rely on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- Train with [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- Revisit [CodeHelp JavaScript Guide](https://www.codehelp.in/tutorial/javascript/java-script-a-beginner-s-guide-to-programming-magic-1)

## 💬 Support

Stuck on a rep? DOM event not firing? Async lifting too heavy?

🏋️ Ask in the group, DM with screenshots, or drop your broken code for a form check. We’ve got your back like a spotter in the gym.

## Final Words

Week 3 is where your JavaScript strength starts to show.

DOM + Events + Async = the **dead lifts** of web development.  
Keep repping, keep pushing — and soon, you’ll be a full-stack beast.

Let’s go DOM-inators! 💥💻
