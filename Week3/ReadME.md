# Week 3 – DOM, Events & Asynchronous JavaScript 🏋️‍♂️

Welcome to Week 3 of the Trackathon journey!

By now, you’ve stretched your basics and lifted some logic reps with core JavaScript. This week, we head to the **next level of gains** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous code.

Think of HTML as the skeleton, CSS as the style — and **JavaScript as the muscles** that bring the body to life.

You’re now in **JavaScript Gym** — time to DOMinate 💪

## ▶️ DOM Concepts & Setup (Optional but 🔥 Recommended)

You don’t need to install anything new this week. But before hitting your reps, warm up with this **DOM and JavaScript essentials video**:

[![DOM & Core JS Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/427pAhy9dI8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/427pAhy9dI8?si=hdlNbb57Y8Z-tJ_W)

🎥 **Why watch this?**  
It helps clarify how DOM works, and builds strong fundamentals for event handling and async logic.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Inside the `Week3` folder:

- `Practice Questions/`
  - `Practice_Set3`: Workouts for DOM + Events.
  - `Practice_Set4`: Async code and error handling — the real hypertrophy stuff.
- `Reading Material/`
  - 📝 No new theory this week.

📌 **Note**:  
The **Week 2 Handwritten Notes** already cover everything you need this week. So don’t wait for new PDFs — just go back, re-read, and soak in the DOM logic.

## 🧠 Learning Plan

1. **Watch the DOM Video (linked above)**  
   It’s like form-checking before lifting — makes your logic stronger.

2. **Revisit the Week 2 Notes**  
   Async/await, promises, event handling — it's all already there.

3. **Smash the Practice Sets**  
   DOM events, interaction logic, async flows — everything you need to build reactive web apps.

## 📜 Assignment Instructions

🧾 No major assignment yet — but don’t skip practice like it’s cardio.

**A day before the deadline**, each of you will be assigned **2 questions** from this week’s practice sets.  
👉 [Submit Your Assigned Questions Here](#)

You don’t want DOM cramps the night before, right?

## 📌 Guidelines

This week’s gym code:

> **Lift the logic, DOMinate the bugs.**

Avoid AI tools. Instead:
- Rely on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- Train with [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- Revisit [CodeHelp JavaScript Guide](https://www.codehelp.in/tutorial/javascript/java-script-a-beginner-s-guide-to-programming-magic-1)

## 💬 Support

Stuck on a rep? DOM event not firing? Async lifting too heavy?

🏋️ Ask in the group, DM with screenshots, or drop your broken code for a form check. We’ve got your back like a spotter in the gym.

## Final Words

Week 3 is where your JavaScript strength starts to show.

DOM + Events + Async = the **compound lifts** of web development.  
Keep repping, keep pushing — and soon, you’ll be a full-stack beast.

Let’s go DOM-inators! 💥💻
