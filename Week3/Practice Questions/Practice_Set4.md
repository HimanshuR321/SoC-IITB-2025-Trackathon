# üöÄ SoC Trackathon - Practice Set 4

Welcome to **Practice Set 4** of the Trackathon Series!  
This set will help you practice Promises, `async/await`, and error handling in JavaScript. These are crucial concepts for writing modern, asynchronous code effectively.

All code must be written in **JavaScript (.js files)**.

## üìù Problem List

1. **Function: Promise Resolve After Delay**  
   Write a function that returns a promise which resolves after a specified number of milliseconds.

2. **Function: Promise Reject After Delay**  
   Write a function that returns a promise which rejects with a specified error message after a specified number of milliseconds.

3. **Function: Promise Resolve with Random Numbers**  
   Write a function that returns a promise which resolves with an array of random numbers after a specified number of milliseconds.

4. **Function: Async/Await API Call**  
   Write a function that uses `async/await` to make an API call to fetch data and returns a promise with the response.

5. **Function: Parallel API Calls Using Async/Await**  
   Write a function that uses `async/await` to make multiple API calls in parallel and returns a promise with an array of responses.

6. **Function: Throw Error for Invalid Parameter**  
   Write a function that throws an error if the parameter is not a number, and handles the error with a custom error message.

7. **Try-Catch: Handle Errors with Custom Message**  
   Write a try-catch block that catches any errors a function throws and logs them to the console with a custom error message.

8. **Function: Assert with console.assert**  
   Write a function that uses `console.assert` to check whether a variable is equal to a certain value, and throws an error if the assertion fails.
