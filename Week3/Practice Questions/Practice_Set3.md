# üöÄ SoC Trackathon - Practice Set 3

Welcome to **Practice Set 3** of the Trackathon Series!  
This set helps you strengthen your understanding of JavaScript DOM events, async operations, and Node.js callbacks.

Each problem focuses on real-world usage like event listeners, API calls, file handling, and basic asynchronous concepts using **callbacks**.  
All code must be written in **JavaScript (.js files)**.
