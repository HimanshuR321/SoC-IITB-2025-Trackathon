# Week 4 – React.js: Build Dynamic UIs Like a Pro 

Let's start with Week 4 of the Trackathon!

By now, you've mastered HTML, styled it with CSS, and added interactivity using JavaScript. This week, we’re entering the world of **React.js**, the go-to library for building modern, interactive user interfaces.

React will help you:
- Build reusable UI components
- Manage dynamic data with ease
- Structure your code more efficiently

## ▶️ Learning Playlist

We’ll follow this YouTube series by CodeHelp — it’s beginner-friendly and well-paced.

[![React Bootcamp Playlist](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kRwmnQDiRWk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9i39jUQljInNAIHUnnZhKrYhLbFt5I_6)


📌 **Skip these for now:**
- Tailwind CSS video
- Deployment video (final one)

Focus on the core React concepts in the remaining videos.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

By the end of this week, you’ll be able to:

- Understand what React is and how it works
- Create and use **functional components**
- Use **JSX** syntax to write HTML in Javascript
- Pass data with **props**
- Handle dynamic data using **useState**
- Fetch data using **useEffect**
- Work with events and conditional rendering

---

## 🧠 Learning Plan

1. **Watch the Playlist**  
   Follow it step-by-step. Pause, code along, rewind if needed.

2. **Explore `/Content`**  
   This folder includes notes for reference. To be very honest, the assignment does not require you to read the complete notes — you can just watch the playlist to understand and build things. But for the sake of formality, and for mentees who want to learn more, I have provided that. These notes are from [TopperWorld](https://topperworld.in).


3. **Get Ready for the `/Assignment`**  
   Because you cannot learn react without using it with your bare hands.

Confused about `useState` or props? Something not rendering?

- Drop a message in the group
- Share your code + screenshot
- Ask clearly and someone will help out

## ✅ Pro Tips

- Use [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) — official docs are super helpful.
- Don’t rush — React has a learning curve. Take your time.
- Focus on **understanding**, not just building.

## Final Note

React is a powerful tool. This week marks your transition into modern frontend development. Once you grasp the basics, the possibilities are endless.

Start building, stay consistent, and don’t hesitate to ask questions.

Let’s React!🚀
