# Week 4 – React.js: Build Dynamic UIs Like a Pro 😎

Welcome to Week 4 of the Trackathon!

By now, you've mastered HTML, styled it up with CSS, and brought it to life using JavaScript. It's time to step into the next phase — **React.js**, one of the most in-demand libraries in modern web development.

This week, we’ll explore how React helps you build **dynamic**, **reusable**, and **maintainable** UI with ease.

## ▶️ Main Learning Resource

We’ll be following this curated **React.js YouTube playlist** from CodeHelp:

🎥 [React Bootcamp – CodeHelp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9i39jUQljInNAIHUnnZhKrYhLbFt5I_6&si=YKSnhAJ1Rfx17oS8)

> **Note:**  
> ❌ Skip the videos on **Tailwind CSS** and **Deployment** for now.  
> ✅ Everything else is essential and should be followed thoroughly.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

By the end of this week, you'll understand:

- What React is and why it's used
- How to create and use **components**
- The role of **JSX**
- Passing data using **props**
- Managing interactive elements with **useState**
- Lifecycle hooks like **useEffect**
- Event handling and conditional rendering
- The basics of React project structure and code organization

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

1. **Watch the Playlist**  
   Follow the videos step by step. Try to code along — React is best learned by doing.

2. **Reinforce Key Concepts**  
   Re-watch or pause when needed. Focus on `useState`, `props`, and component structure.

3. **Explore the `/Content` Folder**  
   It contains notes and snippets for revision and reference.

4. **Try Practice Questions**  
   You'll find short exercises in `/Practice Questions` to apply what you’ve learned.

## 🎲 Assignment

A dedicated video will be shared soon where you will be guided to build a **Dice Game using React**.

The goal is to implement:

- Functional components
- State to track dice value
- Event handling for roll action
- Conditional logic to show outcomes

The assignment will be located in the `/Assignment/` folder when released.

## 💬 Where to Get Help

If something breaks or doesn’t make sense:

- Ask in the group
- Share your code + issue
- Be specific and clear — and someone will definitely jump in to help

---

## ✅ Pro Tips

- Use [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) — they’re excellent and beginner-friendly.
- Avoid blindly copying code — understand what each line is doing.
- Don’t rush. React is foundational for frontend devs, and it's okay to revisit concepts twice.

## Final Note

React might feel different from plain JavaScript at first — but once you get used to **components, state, and props**, it starts to click. Think of this week as your gateway to building modern, scalable, and interactive web apps.

Take your time, stay curious, and enjoy the process.
