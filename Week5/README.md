# Week 5 – Tailwind CSS + React: Build Beautiful UIs, Faster 🚀

Welcome to **Week 5** of the Trackathon!

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you write fast, clean, and responsive designs directly in your JSX — no more switching back and forth between files. It boosts development speed and keeps your UI consistent.

By now, you've explored **React.js** and built interactive components. This week, we’re supercharging our UI development with **Tailwind CSS** — a modern utility-first CSS framework that lets you style directly in your HTML/JSX.
