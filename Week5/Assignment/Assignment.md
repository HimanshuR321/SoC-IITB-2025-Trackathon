# 🛒 Week 5 Assignment – E-Commerce UI with React + Tailwind

Time to put those Tailwind skills to the test! This week’s assignment is all about **crafting a beautiful, modern E-Commerce UI** — just like the ones you see on your favorite online shopping apps.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build the UI of an **e-commerce platform** using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

You have been assigned a **specific page** from the design system and expected to recreate it using components, layouts, and Tailwind’s utility classes.

## 🔗 Design Source (Figma)

🎨 Use this Figma design as your reference:  
**[E-Commerce UI Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/kQXJm3yJwfLinQMJ8qJJ8O/eCommerce-Website-%7C-Web-Page-Design-%7C-UI-KIT-%7C-Interior-Landing-Page--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=ts7za7zvlDzQTgK2-0)**

📌 The **page assigned to you is mentioned at the top of the Figma design** — please check and confirm before starting.

## 🛠 What To Do

- Use **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to replicate the assigned page
- Maintain **component-based structure** (please)
- Layouts should be **responsive**
- Match colors, fonts, spacing, and hierarchy as close as possible
- Don’t worry if it’s not **pixel-perfect** — just try your best

---

## 💎 A few extra if you are enthusiatic (optional)

- Add **basic working features** like:
  - Card swipe animations
  - Hover/transition effects
  - Button click effects
  - Toast messages
  - Email field with validation and send alert
- Add **mobile responsiveness**
- You can enhance the design as long as you preserve the overall structure

## 📝 Submission Details

Make sure your repo has:
- `README.md`
- Proper folder structure (`/components`, `/pages`, etc.)
- Tailwind and React correctly set up
- `.gitignore` excluding `node_modules`, `.env`, etc.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17**  
  ⚠️ _Avoid Tailwind v4.1+ for now due to breaking changes with Oxide engine_

---

## 💡 Tips

- Tailwind works best when used **directly in JSX** — don’t overcomplicate.
- If something isn’t aligning — inspect it with your browser dev tools.
- Follow **mobile-first** design approach.
- Tailwind utility classes are your friends — try to avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Ask doubts in the group if stuck — share a screenshot and describe what’s wrong.

## Final Note

You’re now working like real frontend developers — from design to code. Stay focused, experiment with Tailwind utilities, and bring your assigned UI to life.

Build something clean, functional, and visually sharp.

Let’s get shopping... I mean, **building**! 🛍️✨
