# Week 6 – Intro to Backend Development⚙️

Welcome to **Week 6** of the Trackathon!

This week, we shift gears to explore the **backend** side of web development — the part that handles **data, logic, and connections behind the scenes**. While the frontend (React + Tailwind) makes things look great, it's the backend that gives your app real functionality — user accounts, databases, APIs, and more.

We’ll dive into the foundational tools of modern backend development:
**Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** — the building blocks of many real-world full-stack applications.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

- **Node.js** – A JavaScript runtime that lets you write backend/server-side code using JS. Super important for full-stack devs.
- **Express.js** – A minimalist web framework for Node.js. Think of it as the "React of backend" – fast and flexible.
- **MongoDB** – A popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose** – An elegant MongoDB ODM that lets you define schemas and interact with MongoDB in a structured way.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Modern full-stack apps like Instagram, Zomato, and Spotify all rely on a solid backend. By learning these tools, you’ll be able to:

- Build and serve your own APIs  
- Store and fetch user data  
- Authenticate users and manage sessions  
- Deploy complete full-stack apps  

This is a major step toward becoming a **complete full-stack developer**.

## Final Note

This week is about **depth over speed** — take your time, explore each concept, and experiment locally.

You’ve already built beautiful UIs — now it’s time to make them dynamic and powerful with your own backend.

No assignment this time — just pure learning 💻

Stay consistent, and see you in Week 7!
