# Week 6 – Intro to Backend Development ⚙️

Welcome to **Week 6** of the Trackathon!

This week, we shift gears to explore the **backend** side of web development — the part that handles **data, logic, and connections behind the scenes**. While the frontend (React + Tailwind) makes things look great, it's the backend that gives your app real functionality — user accounts, databases, APIs, and more.

We’ll dive into the foundational tools of modern backend development:  
**Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** — the building blocks of many real-world full-stack applications.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

There’s **no assignment this week**. Instead, you’ll focus entirely on building strong fundamentals in backend development.

📁 Refer to the `/content` folder for the **learning materials** and curated resources for this week.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Modern full-stack apps like Instagram, Zomato, and Spotify all rely on a solid backend. By learning these tools, you’ll be able to:

- Build and serve your own APIs  
- Store and fetch user data  
- Authenticate users and manage sessions  
- Deploy complete full-stack apps  

This is a major step toward becoming a **complete full-stack developer**.

## Final Note

This week is about **depth over speed** — take your time, explore each concept, and experiment locally.

No assignment this time — just pure backend learning 💻  
Stay consistent, and see you in **Week 7**!
