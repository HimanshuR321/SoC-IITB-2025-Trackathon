# TRACKATHON â€“ SoC IITB 2025 ðŸ’» 
_"The only tracker youâ€™ll actually use â€” unlike your fitness app."_

## What Is Trackathon?

Competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef offer excellent opportunities â€” but switching between them constantly? Not so much.  
**Trackathon** is a unified contest tracker that aggregates upcoming contests into a single dashboard. You can bookmark contests, view essential details, and even access curated YouTube solutions â€” all in one streamlined app.

In essence:  
_A well-designed utility for developers who'd rather code than keep a dozen tabs open._
