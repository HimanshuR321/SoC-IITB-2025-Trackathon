# Week 1 – Getting Started with HTML & CSS

Welcome to Week 1 of the Trackathon journey.

This week, we'll begin with the fundamentals of frontend development — HTML and CSS. These technologies form the structure and style of every webpage you interact with.

## Folder Structure

Inside the `week1` folder, you’ll find the following:

- `Assignment/`: Contains the final assignment for this week. You’ll need to submit this via the Google Form linked below.
- `Content/`: Core reading material and examples to help you understand HTML and CSS concepts.
- `README.md`: (This file) Weekly instructions and important notes.

## Learning Plan

1. **Start with the Content folder**  
   Go through the reading materials. These will give you a solid grasp of what HTML and CSS are and how they're used to build web pages.

2. **Complete the Assignment**  
   The assignment will test your understanding of the week's concepts. Complete it and submit via the following Google Form:  
   - [Submission Form]([#](https://forms.gle/i3memnCKqQHEg6Ra6))
   - Deadline: 31st May, 2025

## Guidelines

- For this week, focus on **learning without using AI tools** like ChatGPT for writing or debugging code. The goal is to build your foundational thinking skills.
- If you’re stuck, rely on:
  - [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - Group chat discussions
  - Google search

Avoid the shortcut; this is your phase to develop muscle memory in coding.

## Support

If you face any doubts, feel free to reach out in the group. I'm available to help — just ask your question clearly with a screenshot or error description if possible.

Let’s build the foundation strong. Good luck!
